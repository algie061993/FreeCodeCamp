      <button class="button">And me!</button>

      <p>
        The "Click me!" button will not truning red because its have a
        stopPropagation() Event and it is the first button match(".button")
        selector. (Remember that when it run it reads from top to bottom.) and
        that's the Delegation Event. <br />The 2nd and 3rd buttons will turn red
        because the stopPropagation() Event is applied to the first button
        "Click me!" and that's the Bubbling Event.
